# syntheticfsl
A database application for signing exact English in Filipino Sign Language (FSL) using the JASigning virtual signing system that sythesises natural sign language performance using virtual human characters.


## Sign Database
- Synthetic FSL uses a parametric definition of sign based on the gestural model of HamNoSys.
- Instead of HamNoSys symbols, the app uses Gestural SiGML to describe handshapes and signs making definitions more flexible and accurate.
- Gestural SiGML data are stored in a database for retrieval.
- A graphical user interface is built on top of the database to allow easier editing of signs.

## SyntheSign
SignTyper offers a tool called `SyntheSign`, which automatically converts HamNoSys symbols to synthetic sign animation.

## Current Progress
Inventories of FSL handshapes and basic signs are being uploaded to be used for indexing a small lexicon for FSL signs.

## Future Work

### Towards a translation system for FSL
Resources regarding FSL grammar are being collected for the development of an automatic translation system from English to Filipino Sign Language (FSL) using the current API.
