Motion for Twohanded

	Symmetric
		1. Get all sigml from document and concatenate into single string. (name=rightSeq)
		2. CALL initSingleMotionSequence and pass the string.

	Split Motion
		1. Create new split_motion element.
		
		= RIGHT HAND = 
		2. Get all sigml from document (name=rightSeq) and concatenate into single string.
		3. CALL initSingleMotionSequence and pass the string.
		4. Store the result to variable.
		5. Append the element to split_motion.
		= LEFT HAND = 
		6. Get all sigml from document (name=leftSeq) and concatenate into single string.
		7. CALL initSingleMotionSequence and pass the string.
		8. Store the result to variable.
		9. Append the element to split_motion.

		10. Append split_motion to sign_manual.




1. initSingleMotionSequence [OK]

	Returns a seq_motion element.

	ACTION ITEMS
	=> Get code block from reload();
	=> +PARAMS
		- initial (bool)
	=> initSingleMotionSequence should receive:
		1. initial
			if true, it should append directly to sign_manual.
			else, it should return the seq_motion element.
		2. motionSequence
			string of motions



2. resetModal(e, +PREFIX):

	Resets the modal into default values.
	Uses the "Add new" button as reference.

	ACTION ITEMS
	=> Replace the names of the fields in sign_modal.html. remove "right"
	=> What does the New SeqId block within resetModal() do?
		- So that the save button has id with the latest seq id of the corresponding table.
		- The actual Save Button is passed to saveModal(e);

	=> +PARAMS
		- hand: "right" or "left_" 
		- for counting the current number of elements within the corresponding table.

3. saveModal(e, +PREFIX):

	Adds new row to corresponding table.

	ACTION ITEMS
	=> +PARAMS
		- prefix: "right" or "left_"
	=> update setAttribute("id", PREFIX + SEQID + /attrname/);

4. loadModal


UPDATE TABLE NUMBERING
DELETE MOTION SEQUENCE

NOTES:

	=> We need only to replace the "rightseq" with "seq" only
	=> We need to convert rightSeq into a variable called prefix (name already taken?)


ADD NEW:

1. Click Add new button => resetModal(e);
	
	- reset modal assigns seq id to id and hand to name of save button
